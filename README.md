## File Overview

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pdf_value_extractor.py` | Main extraction engine with all the logic |
| `config.py` | **Centralized configuration** - all settings and predefined rules |
| `excel_exporter.py` | Excel export functionality with professional formatting |
| `run_extraction.py` | Interactive menu system and batch processing |
| `example_usage.py` | Detailed examples and demonstrations |
| `extraction_config.py` | Legacy configuration (still supported) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |

## Configuration System

### Centralized Configuration (`config.py`)

The new centralized configuration system provides:
- **PDF Folder Settings** - Configure where to find PDF files
- **Excel Export Settings** - Control Excel output format and location
- **Predefined Extraction Rules** - 12 ready-to-use extraction configurations

### Excel Export Configuration

```python
# Excel output settings
EXCEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER = ""  # Empty = current directory
EXCEL_FILENAME_PREFIX = "comprehensive_extraction"
EXCEL_INCLUDE_TIMESTAMP = True  # Add timestamp to filename

# Excel formatting options
EXCEL_AUTO_ADJUST_COLUMNS = True  # Auto-adjust column widths
EXCEL_FREEZE_HEADER = True        # Freeze the header row
EXCEL_ADD_FILTERS = True          # Add filters to columns
```

### PDF File Configuration

```python
# Set this to any absolute path where your PDF files are located
# Examples:
#   PDF_FOLDER = r"C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PDFs"
#   PDF_FOLDER = r"D:\Invoice_PDFs"  
#   PDF_FOLDER = "folder"  # Relative to project directory
PDF_FOLDER = "folder"              # Change this to your PDF folder path
FALLBACK_TO_CURRENT_DIR = True     # Use current dir if folder not found
```

The system automatically:
- Accepts both **absolute paths** (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PDFs`) and **relative paths**
- Finds all `.pdf` files in the specified folder
- Falls back to the current directory if the folder doesn't exist
- Processes all found PDF files for extraction

### Excel Output Configuration

```python
# Set this to any absolute path where you want to save Excel files
# Examples:
#   EXCEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER = r"C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Excel_Reports"
#   EXCEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER = r"D:\PDF_Extraction_Results"
#   EXCEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER = ""  # Current directory
EXCEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER = ""           # Change this to your desired output path
EXCEL_FILENAME_PREFIX = "extraction_results"
EXCEL_INCLUDE_TIMESTAMP = True     # Add timestamp to filename
```

## Extraction Modes

The system supports four powerful extraction modes to handle different text extraction scenarios:

### 1. **After Mode** (`extraction_mode="after"`)
Extracts text that appears **after** a search string.

**Example:**
```
PDF Text: "Total Amount: $1,234.56"
Search: "Total Amount:"
Result: "$1,234.56"
```

**Configuration:**
```python
ExtractionConfig(
    name="Invoice Total",
    search_terms=["Total Amount:", "Total:", "Amount Due:"],
    extraction_mode="after",
    expected_type="numbers"
)
```

### 2. **Before Mode** (`extraction_mode="before"`)
Extracts text that appears **before** a search string.

**Example:**
```
PDF Text: "$1,234.56 Total Amount"
Search: "Total Amount"
Result: "$1,234.56"
```

### 3. **Between Mode** (`extraction_mode="between"`) ‚ú® **NEW!**
Extracts text that appears **between** two specific markers.

**Example:**
```
PDF Text: "Contract Period: From 2024-01-01 To 2024-12-31 Duration"
Search: "From"
End Text: "To"
Result: "2024-01-01"
```

**Configuration:**
```python
ExtractionConfig(
    name="Contract Start Date",
    search_terms=["From", "Start Date:"],
    end_text="To",
    extraction_mode="between",
    expected_type="any"
)
```

**Use Cases for Between Mode:**
- Extract date ranges: "From 2024-01-01 To 2024-12-31"
- Extract amounts: "Subtotal $100.00 Tax $10.00"
- Extract addresses: "Address: 123 Main St City: New York"
- Extract contract periods, warranty terms, etc.

### 4. **Around Mode** (`extraction_mode="around"`)
Extracts text in the vicinity of a search string (within a specified distance).

**Example:**
```
PDF Text: "Invoice #12345 dated 2024-01-15 for customer John Doe"
Search: "Invoice"
Result: "Invoice #12345 dated 2024-01-15"
```

### Data Type Validation

- **"numbers"** - Only accepts numeric values, currency symbols, decimals
- **"letters"** - Only accepts alphabetic characters and spaces  
- **"both"** - **NEW!** Accepts text containing both letters and numbers (e.g., "INV-2024")
- **"any"** - Accepts any text

## Predefined Configurations

The system includes 12 comprehensive extraction configurations ready for immediate use:

### Financial Extractions
- **`invoice_total`** - Extract total amounts from invoices
- **`tax_amount`** - Extract tax amounts  
- **`receipt_total`** - Extract receipt totals

### Document Identifiers

- **`phone_number`** - Extract phone numbers
- **`email_address`** - Extract email addresses

### Business Information  
- **`store_name`** - Extract store or business names
- **`party_names`** - Extract party names from contracts

### Date Extractions

- **`contract_date`** - Extract contract dates

### View All Configurations
```python
from config import EXTRACTION_CONFIGS
for name, config in EXTRACTION_CONFIGS.items():
    print(f"{name}: {config.search_terms}")
```

## Excel Export Features

### Professional Formatting

- **Total extractions performed**
- **Success/failure counts**
- **Success rate percentage**
- **Unique PDF files processed**
- **Unique configurations used**
- **Detailed statistics per configuration**

### File Naming
Excel files are automatically named with timestamps:
```
comprehensive_extraction_20241031_113039.xlsx
targeted_extraction_20241031_114522.xlsx
interactive_extraction_20241031_115033.xlsx
```

```

### Example 3: Programmatic Usage

```python
from pdf_value_extractor import PDFValueExtractor, ExtractionConfig

config = ExtractionConfig(
    search_text="Total:",
    extraction_mode="after", 
    expected_type="numbers",
    max_chars=20
)

extractor = PDFValueExtractor(config)
result = extractor.extract_value("invoice.pdf")
print(result)  # Output: "$1,234.56"
```

### Example 4: Extract Text Between Two Markers

```python
config = ExtractionConfig(
    name="Date Range",
    search_terms=["From:", "Start Date:"],
    end_text="To:",
    extraction_mode="between",
    expected_type="any"
)
```

### Example 5: Extract Multiple Values from Multiple PDFs

```python
# In run_extraction.py, uncomment and modify:
configs_to_run = [
    "invoice_number",
    "invoice_total", 
    "customer_name"
]
extract_multiple_configs(configs_to_run)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "No PDF files found"**
- Check that PDF files exist in the specified folder
- Verify the `PDF_FOLDER` setting in `config.py`
- Ensure PDF files have `.pdf` extension
- **For custom paths**: Use absolute paths like `r"C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PDFs"`
- **For network paths**: Use UNC format like `r"\\server\share\PDFs"`
- Test your path by running `python example_custom_paths.py`

**Issue: "No values extracted"**
- Verify search text exists in the PDF
- Check if text is searchable (not scanned image)
- Try adjusting `MAX_CHARACTERS` setting
- Consider using case-insensitive search

**Issue: "Excel file not created"**
- Check write permissions in output directory
- Verify `EXCEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER` setting
- Ensure sufficient disk space

**Issue: "Wrong data type extracted"**
- Adjust `EXPECTED_TYPE` setting:
  - Use "numbers" for amounts
  - Use "letters" for names
  - Use "both" for mixed content (e.g., "INV-2024")
  - Use "any" for unrestricted extraction

### Performance Tips
- Use specific search terms to improve accuracy
- Limit `MAX_CHARACTERS` to reasonable values
- Enable `CLEAN_WHITESPACE` for cleaner results
- Use targeted extraction instead of comprehensive for faster processing
