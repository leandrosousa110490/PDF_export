# Enhanced PDF Text Extractor Requirements
# Install with: pip install -r requirements_enhanced.txt

# Core PDF processing libraries
PyPDF2>=3.0.0
pdfplumber>=0.9.0
PyMuPDF>=1.23.0

# Data processing and export
pandas>=2.0.0
openpyxl>=3.1.0

# Text processing and pattern matching
regex>=2023.0.0

# Configuration and utilities
pathlib2>=2.3.0

# Image processing for redacted content handling

numpy>=1.24.0

# Security Note: OCR functionality has been removed to eliminate external model downloads
# and ensure complete data privacy. The system now relies on built-in PDF text extraction
# methods (PyPDF2, pdfplumber, PyMuPDF) which provide excellent results for most documents.
# Image processing libraries are used only for detecting and removing text from image-based
# redacted content without any external model dependencies.
